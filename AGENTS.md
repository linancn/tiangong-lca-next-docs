Review note, 2026-08-30: The docs hub presents two plain-language tasks, Quick Start explains one five-step first-use exercise, and the overview owns a central four-locale terminology page. Legacy `journey` data markers remain only for output compatibility.

## Repository contract

`tiangong-lca-next-docs` owns the public TianGong LCA documentation site. It is a Next.js 16 App Router application using Fumadocs UI/MDX, TypeScript 7, pnpm, and fully static export. EdgeOne Makers owns build and deployment from Git.

## Load order

1. Read this contract.
2. Read `.docpact/config.yaml`.
3. Route intended paths with `scripts/docpact route --root <absolute-repo-root> --paths <paths> --format json`.
4. Read `docs/agents/repo-architecture.md` and `docs/agents/repo-validation.md` when site structure or validation is involved.
5. Read `README.md` for maintainer commands.
6. Read `TODO.docs-system-gaps.md` when product/documentation drift is involved.
7. Read every locale variant of a changed public page.

## Ownership

This repository owns:

- `content/docs/**` as public content using dot-locale files: Chinese `page.mdx`, then `page.en.mdx`, `page.de.mdx`, and `page.fr.mdx`;
- `app/**`, `components/**`, `lib/**`, and `app/global.css` for routing, metadata, the shared documentation presentation, search, and MDX rendering;
- `public/**` for public media and brand assets;
- `scripts/build.mjs`, `scripts/verify-out.mjs`, `scripts/check-links.mjs`, and `scripts/check-screenshots.mjs` for static output, link, and screenshot-evidence contracts;
- `TODO.docs-system-gaps.md` for durable product/documentation drift.

This repository does not own shipped product behavior, route truth, API semantics, or root integration state. Verify ambiguous behavior in `../tiangong-lca-next`; integrate the resulting child commit in `lca-workspace` separately.

## Runtime facts

- Supported locales are `zh`, `en`, `de`, and `fr`; every public page currently exists in all four.
- `/` renders the complete Chinese home as the `x-default` entry without redirecting. Locale homes remain `/{lang}/`; documents remain `/{lang}/docs/**`.
- Retired paths have no redirect or rewrite compatibility and must remain 404. `manifests/p0b/greenfield-deny.json` is a negative build contract, not a mapping table.
- Public document links use locale-absolute `/{lang}/docs/**/` routes. The link gate checks browser-resolved output, canonical trailing slashes, source-locale ownership, and the normalized internal-link topology across all four variants of a page.
- Docs-impact screenshots use one shared `public/assets/docs/<sha256-prefix>/<semantic-name>.png` asset and explicit zh/en/de/fr document bindings. Added and replaced screenshots must pass the repository validator; replacement never overwrites an existing content-addressed path.
- `SiteBrand`, `DocsHome`, and the Fumadocs Neutral theme define the shared documentation shell. Keep both documentation sites aligned on the 72rem shell, brand-lockup structure, solid plum interaction color, neutral layers, focus treatment, dark mode, low-radius controls, and responsive behavior.
- Product identity belongs in a semantic hero signature rather than a shared decorative motif. This site uses `data-hero-signature="lca-concept-map"` for the reference-data → process-relations → product-system → LCIA-results concept map; TIDAS must retain a distinct data-system/schema signature.
- `/{lang}/docs/` is a task-navigation hub rendered by `DocsPortal`, not a second marketing landing or a directory placeholder. It owns two five-step tasks: assessing a product (`goal/scope -> data checks -> product system -> LCIA -> interpretation/report`) and publishing reusable data (`sources/scope -> TIDAS formatting -> structure/reference checks -> review/publication -> import/export/reuse`). Beginner copy must distinguish automated structure checks, content completeness, human review, data quality, and named methodological compliance. The current contract is `data-docs-portal-map-v2="two-lca-journeys"` plus `data-docs-journey="lca-study|data-production"`; `data-docs-portal="lca-task-hub"` and `data-docs-portal-map="lca-task-route"` remain compatibility markers. Internal links must be locale-absolute, and cross-site TIDAS links must target the same explicit `https://tidas.tiangong.earth/{lang}/docs/**/` locale.
- `/{lang}/docs/overview/glossary/` is the beginner terminology authority in all four locales. It grounds core LCA terms in JRC ILCD primary sources, defines acronyms at first use, and keeps software implementation terms out of entry navigation.
- `/{lang}/docs/quick-start/` is one fixed 10–15 minute, five-step golden path rendered by `QuickStartGuide`; it must contain prerequisites, a sourced sample, ordered actions, completion criteria, failure recovery, and an optional (never required) video. The current contract is `data-quick-start-map-v2="golden-path"` with `data-quick-start-guide="first-session-route"`; `data-quick-start-map="three-stage-onboarding"` is a compatibility marker only and must not reintroduce a branch.
- The remaining top-level category roots render `CategoryDirectory` from only `lang` and `category`. Directory order and membership come from the localized Fumadocs page tree / `meta*.json`; titles and descriptions come from child-page metadata, with a bounded first-paragraph fallback. Never hand-maintain category entry lists in index MDX.
- Reuse exported Fumadocs primitives such as `buttonVariants`, `Card`, and `Cards`. Custom presentation is limited to theme tokens, the shared shell, and product-specific concept or navigation figures; do not add gradients, glow, shadow, or lift animation to public actions.
- `next.config.ts` sets `agentRules: false` because this governed file, not generated development-server text, is authoritative.
- The runtime contract accepts Node `>=24.18.0 <25` while pnpm `11.24.0` and TypeScript `7.0.2` remain exact. `.nvmrc` selects Node major `24`, EdgeOne pins its preinstalled `24.18.0`, and reviewed GitHub workflows use Node `24.19.0`; every selector must satisfy the bounded contract before static generation.
- EdgeOne's managed Node runtime already supplies pnpm. Its install command runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` directly; do not run `corepack enable` in the managed build because that mutates shims beside the platform-owned Node executable. Local contributor setup may still enable Corepack.
- Markdown lint uses the exact local `markdownlint-cli2` dependency through `pnpm exec`. Active repository automation has no npm/npx fallback, and every external GitHub Action is pinned to a reviewed executable commit rather than a tag object or moving tag.
- Public AI retrieval is derived at build time through `/llms.txt` and `/search-records.json`; internal governance files remain excluded by `context7.json`.
- Reconciliation has two trust boundaries: production validates indexability and then enters the GitHub production environment for Algolia/Context7 mutation; preview validates `noindex`/robots plus production-canonical policy in a separate job path that cannot access those mutation steps.

## Required commands

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check:links
DEPLOY_ENV=ci CANONICAL_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_MODE=static pnpm build
```

`pnpm build` runs bounded Node 24 plus exact package-tool environment validation, the general Node contract/link tests, static export, output-contract verification, and source/generated link validation. Screenshot-validator tests intentionally remain outside `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, pull-request CI, and release CI; only the docs-impact mapped/replay worker runs `pnpm test:screenshots` before validating a visual manifest. For visual changes, also inspect light and dark themes at 390px, 1440px, the 1633px large-desktop regression width, and an ultra-wide viewport using a real browser.

## Hard boundaries

- Keep all four locale variants aligned in the same change.
- Do not add redirects, rewrites, or compatibility copies for retired routes.
- Do not expose internal agent, plan, incident, TODO, or governance documents through public AI indexes.
- Do not introduce npm/npx execution, a second lockfile, movable external action references, or a second compiler generation.
- Do not treat a successful child merge as workspace delivery completion while the root gitlink remains stale.
- Record partial product/documentation drift in `TODO.docs-system-gaps.md` during the same session.
- Run strict Docpact validation and lint for governance changes.

## Workspace integration

A merged PR here is repository-complete only. Delivery completes after the exact eligible child commit is deliberately pinned and validated in the workspace root.

## Local Docpact push gate

Install the versioned hook once per checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The pre-push hook delegates to `scripts/docpact-gate.sh`, validates configuration strictly, and lints against `origin/main` unless an explicit base is supplied.
