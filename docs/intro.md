## User Guide

The TianGong LCA system consists of three main modules: My Data, TianGong Data, and Personal Page.

### My Data

The **My Data** module is composed of six sections: Unit Process, Flow, Flow Property, Unit, Data Source, and Contact, allowing users to build data as needed.

-**Unit Process**

  -Users can create a new unit process by clicking the "+" button on the page.

  -In the Input/Output Flow section, users can add related input/output flows by clicking the "+" button.

-**Flow**

  -Users can create a new flow by clicking the "+" button.

  -After successfully creating a new flow, a "Model" can be built on the right side.

  -In the model-building page, users can create and edit models by clicking the "+" button.

  -In the model editing page, users can add nodes by clicking the "+", adjust directions by dragging the edges of the node boxes, and add basic model information by clicking the "i" on the right.

  -Click the directional arrow and select "Exchange Relationship" to add exchange relationships by choosing the source output flow and target input flow.

-**Flow Property**

  -Users can create new flow properties by clicking the "+" button.

-**Unit**

  -Users can create new units by clicking the "+" button.

```bash
The Unit module in TianGong Data is constructed according to international standards and can be directly referenced by users.
```
-**Data Source**

  -Users can create new data sources by clicking the "+" button and add electronic documents related to data files.

-**Contact**

  -Users can create new contacts by clicking the "+" button, allowing them to input personal and team information.
