# Data Review

Data review is no longer just “submit and wait.” It involves distinct workspaces and responsibilities
 for authors, review members, and review admins. This page is organised as **pre-submit steps →
roles → review workspace → FAQ**.

## Before submission

Before sending data into review from **My Data**, complete two steps first:

1. Run **Data check**
2. Click **Submit for review**

![Data check button](img/data-check.png)

If the platform finds blocking issues during submission, it opens a problem list. Fix those issues
first, then submit again.

![Submission validation prompt](img/data-problem.png)

For process datasets, **Submit for review** first enters the **Numerical stability gate**. Common
states include “Review submission is queued,” “Numerical stability gate is running,” “Review
submission is waiting for the numerical stability gate to finish,” and “Numerical stability gate
passed. Submitting for review now.” If the page says submission is still processing in the
background, click **Submit for review** again later to refresh the latest status. If the gate blocks
submission, fix the reported data issues, save again, and resubmit.

## Who does what

| Role | Primary responsibility | Main entry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Author | Model data, self-check, submit for review, revise after feedback | My Data |
| Review member (`review-member`) | Review assigned tasks and submit review comments | Avatar menu → Review Management |
| Review admin (`review-admin`) | Assign work, track progress, manage review members, approve or reject the full review | Avatar menu → Review Management |
| Team admin | Coordinate with authors and help track project progress | My Team, [notification center](./notifications) |

> Review roles and team roles are different permission systems. A person may have both, or only one
> of them.

## How to open the review workspace

Users with a review role can open **Review Management** from the avatar menu in the top-right
corner.

This workspace is role-gated and does not stay visible in the left navigation for everyone.

The marked area `1` shows the tabs visible to the current account. This screenshot is a
`review-member` example; a `review-admin` sees a different management-oriented tab set.

## Review admin workspace

When a `review-admin` opens Review Management, the current tabs are:

- **Unassigned Task**
- **Assigned Task**
- **Rejected Task**
- **Member Management**

### Unassigned Task

This is where newly submitted reviews are assigned to review members.

Typical actions include:

- Selecting multiple tasks in bulk
- Opening **Select Reviewer**
- Setting a review deadline
- Rejecting the review at the whole-task level

Use this tab first whenever a new submission still needs reviewer assignment.

### Assigned Task

This tab is for monitoring already assigned work.

Review admins can typically:

- Check review progress
- Open **Review Progress**
- Add more reviewers to unfinished work
- Revoke reviewers that are still pending
- Approve or reject the whole review

### Rejected Task

This tab stores tasks that were rejected at the review-admin level, making it easier to trace what
needs to be revised or reassigned.

### Member Management

**Member Management** is where the review team itself is maintained. Typical actions include:

- Adding review members
- Removing review members
- Promoting `review-member` to `review-admin`
- Demoting `review-admin` back to `review-member`
- Inspecting each member's pending and reviewed counts

## Review member workspace

When a `review-member` opens Review Management, the current tabs are:

- **Reviewed**
- **Pending Review**
- **Rejected**

### Pending Review

This is the main working area for review members. It lists the tasks currently assigned to the
logged-in reviewer.

Common actions include:

- Opening task details
- Filling in review feedback
- Using **Temporary Save** to keep work in progress
- Using **Save** to submit the review result

The editing experience differs by object type:

- Process review is more form-oriented
- Model review typically combines graph views with a right-side information panel

### Reviewed

This tab shows tasks that the current review member has already processed.

### Rejected

This tab is mainly for tasks that were rejected at the review-admin level.

If a task appears here, it usually means the whole review flow was rejected, not just that an
individual reviewer wrote a negative comment.

## What authors should know

Even if an author does not have a review role, they should still understand the review rhythm:

1. Finish modelling and self-check in **My Data**
2. Click **Submit for review**
3. Wait for a review admin to assign reviewers
4. Revise according to review feedback
5. Resubmit if necessary

Also watch the **Data Notifications** tab in the top-right [notification center](./notifications) so
that review feedback is not missed.

## Status filters

Review-related lists commonly include status filters to help locate items at different stages.

![Review status filters](img/review-status.png)

In practice, interpret those statuses through your role:

- Authors care whether they must revise something
- Review members care which tasks are still pending
- Review admins care which tasks are unassigned or stuck

## FAQ

### Why can’t I see Review Management?

Because the entry is shown only to `review-admin` and `review-member`. Regular authors can submit
for review without having access to the review workspace itself.

### Why did submission not immediately become an active review?

Submission only enters the workflow. A review admin usually still needs to assign reviewers before
the real review work begins.

### I am a team admin. Why do I still not see Review Management?

Because team administration and review roles are separate permission domains.

### Where can I compare all of these permissions quickly?
